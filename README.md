# liferay-portal-gen-idea
Generates IDEA project files for Liferay Portal and makes them importable by Intellij.

## Usage

- Open a terminal window
- cd /path/to/your/copy/of/liferay-portal
- /path/to/your/copy/of/liferay-portal-gen-idea/gen-idea.sh
- Now open Intellij and open (do not import) the root of liferay-portal

Notice: By default this script doesn't generate the .idea files for all modules, just the ones necessary to dynamic-data-mapping and dynamic-data-lists. Update according to your needs.
